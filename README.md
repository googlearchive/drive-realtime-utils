# Google Drive Realtime API Utility

## Overview

The Google Drive Realtime API Utility is a lightweight JavaScript library aimed
at simplifying authentication to Google Drive as well as various other features.

Simply pass in an object with the following properties

1. **appId** - the appId of your project found in the developers console.

You can instantiate the utility by running the following code.

```javascript
var util = new utils.RealtimeUtils({
	appId: 'YOUR APPID',
});
```

After instantiating the utility, start the authorization process by calling
`authorize` and passing in a callback function for after authentication.
`authorize` also accepts a boolean parameter, true to use a popup or false to
try and authenticate without a popup.

After authentication, the realtime utiltiy has several helper functions.
Outlined below are the various functions and parameters that can be called.

### RealtimeUtils.authorize(onAuthComplete, usePopup)
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>onAuthComplete</td>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td>
      This function is a callback for the authorization process. Once completed,
      this function will be invoked. This function will have an authentication
      result object as an argument describing if the authentication was
      successful.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>usePopup</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>
      If true, the user will be prompted to authenticate via a popup. The
      general authentication flow should only require this if it is the first
      time the user has authenticated. Subsequent authentications will not
      require a popup.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### RealtimeUtils.createRealtimeFile(title, callback)
This function will create a new Realtime file and store it in Google Drive.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>

    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>String</td>
    <td>
      The name of the newly created document. Note that all new files are
      created using the <code>'application/vnd.google-apps.drive-sdk'</code>
      mime type. To override this mimetype, pass in mimeType and a stirng value
      as an option when instantiating RealtimeUtils.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>callback</td>
    <td>Function</td>
